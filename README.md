# Web & Mobile Development Course Materials

This collection of slides form the course materials for the Web & Mobile Development _(formerly Rich Internet Applications)_ course, part of the [Professional Bachelor ICT](http://www.ikdoeict.be/) study programme, taught at [KaHo Sint-Lieven](http://www.kahosl.be/), Ghent, Belgium.

The materials were developed by Bram(us) Van Damme who blogs over at [bram.us](http://www.bram.us/) and Twitters as [@bramus](http://twitter.com/bramus), and Davy De Winne.

The materials may be used freely, as long as credit to the authors is present and the top right graphical link to [ikdoeict.be](http://www.ikdoeict.be/) remains in place.

The engine powering the slide decks is a customized [Reveal.js](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/). More info on this can be found in the first set of slides.
